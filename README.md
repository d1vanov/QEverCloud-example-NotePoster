QEverCloud example: NotePoster
==============================

## What's this

NotePoster is a demo/example application using [QEverCloud](https://github.com/d1vanov/QEverCloud) library for adding notes to Evernote.

## How it works

In order to use the application you need to either have a [developer token](https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action) for Evernote service
and your account's [NoteStore URL](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/core_concepts.php) or retrieve both via [OAuth](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/authentication.php).

When you get the developer token and NoteStore URL, you need to enter it to the relevant fields of the app's startup window and press "Ok".
Then you'd be able to enter the simple text notes and send them to your Evernote account.
